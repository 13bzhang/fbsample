# fbsample

R Package for Quota Sampling on Facebook

This R package makes it easier for one to conduct quota sampling via Facebook advertisements. `fbsample` serves two main functions. First, it allows one to specify which demographic groups to target. Second, it uses R wrapper functions in [fbRads](https://github.com/cardcorp/fbRads) to create ads in batches and upload them via the [Facebook Marketplace API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis).
